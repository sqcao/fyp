[win first time]
I win! I told you I am the top student in this school!
I will always win, watch it!

[win more than one time]
I win again! I suggest you surrender!
You lost again, how do you explain this time?
Give up!You have no chance to win me!

[lost first time]
Listen, this time is because I let you win!
This is the first time, also the last time!

[lost more than one time]
You will not be so lucky everytime! I will show you that you win is all because of your luck!
Next time I will beat you, watch it!
