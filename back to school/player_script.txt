[win first time]
I win! Jandon, you still want to challenge me?
You still have chance to quit now, Jandon.

[win more than one time]
I win again! Jandon, if I were you I will surrender!
You lost again Jandon, what do you want to say this time?
Jandon, you should know you have no chance to win me!

[lost first time]
Cher, let you win one time Jandon!
Do you think you will win all the time?

[lost more than one time]
Don't be so confident! I will win it back!
Next time I will beat you, I swear!
